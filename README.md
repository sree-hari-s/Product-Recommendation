# Product Recommendation for E-commerce

This is a simple E-commerce Recommendation System implemented using Streamlit and Python. It allows users to filter products by category, select a product, and get recommendations based on the selected product.

## Installation Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the E-commerce Recommendation System project on your local machine by forking the repository and running it using Streamlit.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository

1. On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL to clone the repository.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project by using the `cd` command.

4. Clone the repository by running the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the URL you copied:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

## Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

1. Navigate to the cloned project directory using the `cd` command.

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

1. While inside the project directory and with the virtual environment activated (if used), install project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Step 5: Run the Application

1. Run the Ecommerce Recommendation System application using Streamlit:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. This will start the Streamlit app locally, and you can access it in your web browser.
